1/5 Hey folks! I'm pumped to share my latest personal project: a Chrome extension for instant fact-checking! Check out this quick video demo. It's like having a lie detector right in your browser - no more falling for fake news!

2/5 This bad boy is powered by an AI Fact Checker API I built, supercharged with Google Fact Check and GDELT APIs. And get this - it doesn't just read text, it can describe images too! It's like teaching your browser to think critically.

3/5 Here's the cool part: it can whip up tweets about fact-checks faster than you can say "that's not true!" Imagine browsing, fact-checking, AND tweeting about it in seconds. It's like your browser suddenly became a truth-seeking superhero!

4/5 I've made it flexible too. Whether you're Team GPT-4 or Team Claude, this extension's got your back. It's like choosing between different superpowers - they're all awesome!
